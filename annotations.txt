try except:
    - raise keyword: raise an exception if a condition occurs and stop the program.
    - assert keyword: check whether a condition is met and let python raise the AssertionError if the condition isn't met,
        program should only attempt to run if the conditions are in place.
        running the program with python3 -o app.py, -o will remove all asserts
    
    basically:
        - raise allows you to raise an exception at any time.
        - assert enables you to verify if a certain condition is met and raises an exception if it isnâ€™t.
        - In the try clause, all statements are executed until an exception is encountered.
        - except allows you to catch and handle the exception or exceptions that Python encountered in the try clause.
        - else lets you code sections that should run only when Python encounters no exceptions in the try clause.
        - finally enables you to execute sections of code that should always run, whether or not Python encountered any exceptions.

        - to create a customized exception do:  class ExceptionName(Exception)
