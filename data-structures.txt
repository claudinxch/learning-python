Data Structures and Algorithms - DSA
    Data Structures = different ways of storing data on your computer
    Algorithms = operations on different data structures + sets of instructions for executing them

DS:
    - Array is a linear data structure that can hold elements and arrange them. It uses contiguous memory space to store elements.
        We can directly access any element based on its index. Arrays have two types: one-dimensional (linear form) and multi-dimensional (form of matrix or 3D format).

    - Linked Lists are dynamic data structures that store elements in individual nodes, with each node pointing to the next.
        Each item is stored in different memory locations, which each item pointing to the next item's memory address.
    - Stacks follow the Last-In-First-Out principle (LIFO) and primarily assist in function calls in most programming languages.
    - Queues operate on the First-In-First-Out principle (FIFO) and are commonly used in task scheduling.
    - Hash Tables store key-value pairs allowing for fast insertion, deletion and search operations.

Big O notation:
    Notation that indicates the performance or complexity of an algorithm.
    Allows you to compare the number of operations and know how fast an algorithm is.
    There are some most common notations like O(1), O(n), O(log n), O(n log n), O(n²), O(n³), O(n!).
    It always describe the worst case.
